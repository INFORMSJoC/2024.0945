## Description

This software implements algorithms to find the most degree and betweenness-central shortest paths in a graph in Python. Specifically, this includes Algorithms 1 and 2 from this paper, and Algorithm 1 from Matsypura et al. (2023), which is referred to as Algorithm MVP in this paper.

## Requirements

This code has been written in Python 3.12, and in addition to the standard Python libraries, requires the following packages:

- `networkx`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`

## Results

Tables 1-7 in the paper show the results of the timing tests with different graphs on Mac Studio (2023) with Apple M2 Ultra and 128 GB of RAM running macOS Ventura 13.6.

## Replicating

To replicate the results in Tables 1-7, do

```
python scripts/timing.py
```

You may choose to enable multiprocessing by setting `use_multiprocessing = True` and specifying the number of threads with the variable `n_jobs`.
